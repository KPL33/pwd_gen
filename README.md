Random Password Generator

In this repository, please find the files necessary for a "Random Password Generator", which should meet the client's acceptance criteria. I have satisfied the requests of the client in the following manner...
• Created an application that enables employees to generate random, secure passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected.
• This program runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written.
• Please see notes provided in the associated 'script.js' file, for logic regarding the code and more details.
